## About Me

Tiffany Szeto is a California-born fashion designer and passionate globetrotter. Drawing inspiration from her international studies background, Tiffany's keen eye for colors and prints is evident in her designs.
Her love for fashion started early, watching her mother get ready for work and realizing the power of clothing to boost self-esteem. Since then, her dream has been to provide women with dreamy wardrobes that suit any body and personality.
With a focus on wovens, Tiffany also has experience in childrenswear, graphic tees, outerwear, and cut & sew knits. Her ultimate joy comes from designing for mass and contemporary retailers, reaching and empowering fashion enthusiasts everywhere.
Currently, she is an associate designer for the brand LC Lauren Conrad with an emphasis in woven tops, skirts, and knits.
Join Tiffany on her journey of creativity and wanderlust, where she weaves stories through garments and makes dreams come true, one stitch at a time.
